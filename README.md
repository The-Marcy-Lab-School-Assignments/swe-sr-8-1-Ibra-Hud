For guidance on setting up and submitting this assignment, refer to the Marcy lab School Docs How-To guide for [Working with Short Response and Coding Assignments](https://marcylabschool.gitbook.io/marcy-lab-school-docs/fullstack-curriculum/how-tos/working-with-assignments#how-to-work-on-assignments).

## Prompt

![Fullstack Diagram](./client-server-database-diagram.svg)

You’ve been given a diagram (see above) showing the three core layers of a fullstack application:

- Frontend – a React application that users interact with
- Backend – an Express server that handles logic and communication
- Database – a PostgreSQL database that stores persistent data

Imagine you’re explaining how these layers work together by using a real-world example: Instagram.

Your task:

1. Explain how Instagram works using the three-layer diagram.
   * What happens when a user opens the app, scrolls through their feed, likes a post, or uploads a new photo?
   * Walk through how data flows from the frontend to the backend and to the database—and back again.

2. Come up with an analogy to help someone new to coding understand these layers.
  * You might compare the system to something like a restaurant, a library, or even a post office—anything that helps make the roles of each layer intuitive.
  * Make sure your analogy maps clearly to the roles of the frontend, backend, and database.

3. Reflect on the value of this separation.
  * Why do we separate concerns into these layers?
  * What would go wrong if we tried to do everything in one layer?

Audience: Imagine you're writing this for someone who's just starting out in web development and wants to understand how modern apps work.

Length: Around 400–600 words.

# Response

### How Instagram Works – A Fullstack Breakdown (with a Restaurant Analogy)

Modern web applications like Instagram are built using a **three-layer fullstack architecture**:

- **Frontend** – the part of the app users interact with (built with React)
- **Backend** – the server that handles business logic and talks to the database (built with Express)
- **Database** – the storage system where data is saved (like PostgreSQL)

To understand how these layers work together, let’s imagine Instagram is a **restaurant**.

---

### The Analogy: A Restaurant

- **Frontend (React)** is the **menu and waitstaff**. It’s what customers (users) see and use. They view the menu (UI), place orders (click buttons), and interact with the staff (components and user inputs).
  
- **Backend (Express)** is the **kitchen and manager**. When a customer places an order, the waiter (frontend) sends it to the kitchen (backend), where it’s prepared. The backend makes decisions: what to cook, how to cook it, or whether to reject the order (like checking user permissions).

- **Database (PostgreSQL)** is the **pantry**. It stores all the ingredients (data): photos, likes, comments, user profiles. The kitchen (backend) grabs ingredients from the pantry (queries the database), cooks the meal (processes logic), and sends it out through the waiter to the customer.

### A Day on Instagram

Let’s walk through what happens in the app:

#### 1. **Opening the app & scrolling the feed**
- The **frontend** (React) loads a clean UI and asks the **backend** for the latest posts.
- The **backend** (Express) receives this request, queries the **database** (PostgreSQL) for the user’s feed, sorts it by relevance or recency, and returns the data.
- The **frontend** takes that data and displays it as scrollable posts with photos, captions, and likes.

#### 2. **Liking a post**
- When a user taps the heart icon, the **frontend** sends a “like” request to the **backend**.
- The **backend** verifies the user is logged in and has permission to like.
- If it checks out, the **backend** updates the **database** with a new like entry and returns a confirmation.
- The **frontend** updates the UI to show the like in real time.

#### 3. **Uploading a photo**
- The user selects a photo and hits “Upload”.
- The **frontend** sends the image and metadata (caption, tags, etc.) to the **backend**.
- The **backend** saves the photo, processes it (maybe adds filters), and stores the details in the **database**.
- The **frontend** then updates the user’s profile with the new post.

---

### Why Separate These Layers?

Each layer has a clear job:

- **Frontend** focuses on user experience and interactivity.
- **Backend** handles logic, decisions, and security.
- **Database** ensures reliable and efficient storage.

This **separation of concerns** keeps apps modular, scalable, and easier to maintain. For example:

- If Instagram wants to redesign the interface, they can do so without changing the database.
- If they want to switch from PostgreSQL to another database, the backend logic would adapt without breaking the frontend.

---

### What If Everything Was One Layer?

Imagine if the restaurant made customers walk into the kitchen, grab ingredients, and cook their own food. It’d be chaotic, insecure, and inefficient.

Similarly, if you tried to mix UI, logic, and data storage all in one file or system, things would get messy fast. Bugs would be harder to track, features harder to scale, and security risks would multiply.

---

### Final Thoughts

Understanding the fullstack is like understanding how a well-run restaurant works behind the scenes. You see a smooth experience on the surface, but under the hood, many moving parts are working together—each with its own job, connected through clear communication. That's how apps like Instagram can be fast, responsive, and user-friendly at the same time.
